# Exam Automation Web Application

This web application was built during my time at Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Nigeria (RAIN). Using Python's Flask framework, I developed an automated platform to replace paper-based exams â€” saving significant man-hours and resources. The project incorporates user authentication via `flask_login`, robust database management using SQLAlchemy, and a user-friendly exam input process through an Excel template generated with openpyxl.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to streamline the exam process. Instead of printing and grading paper-based multiple-choice exams, the application allows examiners to easily input questions and options via an Excel template. Students can take exams online, and results are stored securely in a database.
